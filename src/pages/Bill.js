            <h2>“Being able to talk about what I want in the classroom, what my needs are and then taking that vision and making it happen, that part has been really invaluable”</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Bill Ju, an associate professor in the Human Biology department, had a vision for how he wanted to deliver his lecture materials. He wanted a high-quality camera that would follow and track his movements, but he failed to find one that produced satisfactory results. He contacted the Tech2U team for support on the matter, and the team troubleshot alongside him to make his vision a reality without having to compromise on quality. Along with this concern, Dr. Ju had anxieties surrounding starting class on time and being confident in the technology that was going to be used.
                <br/><br/>
                To address these concerns, the Tech2U team tried several equipment options, but none matched Dr. Ju's vision. While the professor loved the quality of the Logitech webcam, he opted to continue searching, as that webcam could not track his movements. The team tried the Alertoa Face tracking camera, which met his tracking standard at the price of the quality. The Tech2U team, determined to find a setup that Dr. Ju was pleased with, amended the Alertoa setup to include the Logitech camera, which finally fulfilled the professor's objective.  
                <br/><br/>
                With Tech2U's support, Dr. Ju was confident that the equipment worked prior to the start of his class, which resulted in minimal wasted time and maximum engagement for students in both the virtual and in-person spaces. He notes that Tech2U makes available real people who work with you to ease tensions that come with online and dual delivery teaching. Dr. Ju adds that the program supports his mental health and wellbeing, as he finds comfort in knowing that the help he requires is so accessible. Not only does the support he receives from Tech2U benefit him, but it also creates a more engaging environment for his students, as they can interact with the material and each other better than they could have without.  
                <br/><br/>
