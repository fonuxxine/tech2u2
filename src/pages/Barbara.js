            <h2>“Alex never left me starting a lecture without knowing that everything was working perfectly”</h2>
            <p>
                Barbara Ballyk has taught at the university for 20 years and has developed a strong teaching approach focused on student engagement, however when confronted with the decision to offer her lessons through dual delivery, she knew she'd need support. Barbara reached out to Tech2U for help in providing lectures optimal for a hybrid class. An additional challenge was to ensure that her teaching method of annotating slides and adding text by hand was equally engaging for her students physically in the class and in virtual attendance.
                <br/><br/>
                Barbara reached out to the Tech2U team and was connected with a Co-Pilot, Alex, who successfully addressed each tech challenge Barbara was faced with. For instance, she was concerned about volume because she wanted to make sure she was adequately heard by her remote students and that they could also be heard by everyone physically in class. She also hoped to show all students her annotations throughout the lecture. While Alex did admit that this part was challenging to set up due to having to connect various equipment including the touch screen monitor and web cam, his collaboration with Barbara ultimately guaranteed smooth lectures all year long. For Barbara, it was a huge relief to know that by the time she was ready to start class, everything was already set up and the only thing she had to focus on was her lecture. 
                <br/><br/>
                By the end of the year, students expressed gratitude to Barbara and Tech2U for dedicating so much effort to the technical aspect of class. Barbara also reflected on her collaboration with her Co-Pilot and the strong rapport she built with him and realized how much she'd learned from him. Overall, the support Barbara received from Tech2U gave her security in knowing she could rely on her Co-Pilot for tech issues and be provided the space she needed to teach engaging lessons. 
                <br/><br/>
