            <h2>“Using Tech2U, I felt better at the end of the day” </h2>
            <p>
                As a kinesiology and physical education professor, Doug Richards emphasizes was interested in recording his lectures in a way that incorporated more than just audio since many aspects of his lessons involve physically demonstrating exercises and using anatomical models to display specific injuries. Also, Doug wanted to be able to switch video focus from his PowerPoint slides to his face. In this way, students would be able to concentrate solely on the professor and less so on what's displayed on the PowerPoint screen. 
                <br/><br/>
                To address Doug's need, the Tech2U team connected him with a Co-Pilot, Alex, to assist lecture recordings and set up the technological equipment required for Doug to be able to switch between his PowerPoint and video recording of his demonstrations. Alex first set up a camera in the fourth row of the lecture theater to record, and then provided Doug with a remote which would allow him to switch between the PowerPoint and modeling sections of the lecture. This approach helped Doug conduct his lecture smoothly and helped him feel more comfortable with the technology required. In fact, by the end of the term, Doug reported that using the technology for his lectures “became second nature”. 
                <br/><br/>
                Reflecting on his overall experience with Tech2U and receiving support from his Co-Pilot, Doug found that he learned a lot and his students expressed feeling appreciative of the way his lectures were recorded, especially during the transition to hybrid lessons and back to in-person learning. Ultimately, knowing that he had access to someone who could support him in improving the quality of his recordings and help him include a crucial aspect of his teaching practice was extremely valuable.
                <br/><br/>
